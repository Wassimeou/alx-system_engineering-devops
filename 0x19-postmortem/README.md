Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from March 5th, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC to March 6th, 2024, at 4:00 PM UTC.
Impact: The web application was completely inaccessible for all users during this time, affecting 100% of our user base.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database failure due to a misconfiguration in the replication setup.
Timeline:

10:00 AM (UTC) - The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in database errors.
10:10 AM (UTC) - Engineers began investigating the issue, assuming it was related to a recent code deployment.
11:00 AM (UTC) - Misleadingly, the focus shifted towards a potential network issue, leading to unnecessary downtime.
12:30 PM (UTC) - With no resolution in sight, the incident was escalated to the database administration team.
2:00 PM (UTC) - Database administrators identified the root cause as a misconfiguration in the replication setup.
4:00 PM (UTC) - The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the database replication and ensuring proper failover mechanisms.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was traced back to a misconfiguration in the database replication setup. Specifically, a recent change in the replication configuration led to inconsistencies between primary and secondary databases, causing the primary database to become unresponsive.

To resolve the issue, database administrators reconfigured the replication settings to ensure consistency between databases. Additionally, failover mechanisms were reinforced to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect replication inconsistencies promptly.
Implement automated failover testing procedures to validate failover mechanisms regularly.
Review and update documentation regarding database configuration and failover procedures.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch database replication configuration to prevent future misconfigurations.
Conduct a thorough review of recent changes to identify any other potential misconfigurations.
Schedule regular training sessions for engineers on database administration best practices.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future and ensure the continued reliability and availability of our web application.
